# Changelog

All notable changes to MCP Gateway will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- **Direct GitHub execution**: Committed dist/ files for `npx github:sting8k/mcp-gateway`
- **Config hot reload**: Auto-reloads when config files change (300ms debounce)

### Changed
- **Renamed**: Super MCP Router â†’ MCP Gateway
- **Installation**: GitHub as primary method (no npm publish needed)
- **Documentation**: Streamlined README from 430 to 137 lines
- **Repository**: Updated URLs to sting8k/mcp-gateway

### Fixed
- HTTP transport reconnect issues
- .DS_Store files removed from git tracking

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-11

### Added
- **Zero-config setup**: Automatically creates `~/.super-mcp/` directory and config on first run
- **CLI for adding MCPs**: Simple `add` command to add pre-configured MCP servers
- **Empty config support**: Super MCP Router now works with no MCPs configured (minimal mode)
- **Auto-setup**: Creates directories, logs folder, and empty config automatically

### Changed
- **Simplified onboarding**: No manual config creation needed - just add to Claude and restart
- **Default config location**: Now defaults to `~/.super-mcp/config.json` if no config specified
- **Better first-run experience**: Helpful messages guide users on next steps

### Fixed
- Config validation no longer requires at least one server

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-11

### Added
- **Comprehensive error messaging**: All errors now provide actionable diagnostics and troubleshooting steps
- **Environment variable expansion**: Support for `${VAR}` and `$VAR` syntax in configuration files
- **JSON Schema format validation**: Added support for standard formats (date, date-time, email, etc.) via ajv-formats
- **OAuth token invalidation**: Automatic cleanup of invalid OAuth tokens when "Client ID mismatch" occurs
- **Enhanced health check diagnostics**: Detailed per-package status with suggested actions
- **Improved validation errors**: Clear guidance on missing/incorrect arguments with schema hints

### Changed
- **Security improvement**: Only explicitly configured environment variables are passed to MCP servers (no longer passes entire process.env)
- **Better connection error handling**: Specific diagnostics for command not found, permission denied, and network issues
- **Clearer tool execution errors**: Context-aware error messages based on failure type (timeout, auth, permissions)

### Fixed
- **Notion OAuth browser not opening**: Fixed issue where browser wouldn't open when invalid tokens were present
- **Notion search failures**: Fixed validation errors with date formats in Notion search filters
- **Environment variable security**: Prevented leaking of all system environment variables to MCP servers

### Security
- Environment variables are now isolated per MCP server - each server only receives explicitly configured variables
- Sensitive values (tokens, keys) are never logged in debug output

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-09

### Added
- Support for multiple configuration files via multiple --config arguments
- Support for comma-separated config paths in SUPER_MCP_CONFIG environment variable
- Automatic merging of servers from multiple config files (duplicates handled gracefully)

### Changed
- Configuration loading now supports both single and multiple file inputs
- Backward compatible - existing single config setups continue to work unchanged

## [1.0.4] - 2025-01-09

### Changed
- Reorganized README to prioritize npx (no-installation) method
- Improved documentation flow to make getting started easier
- Moved installation methods to a dedicated section

## [1.0.3] - 2025-01-09

### Fixed
- Fixed critical stdout pollution issue that broke MCP protocol when using npx
- Logger now correctly outputs to stderr instead of stdout, ensuring clean JSON-RPC communication
